## Data Science in Biomechanics Research

The field of biomachanics is among those which is undergoing a revolution with the emergence of data science and machine learning toolsl. Among the organizations taking advantage of data science in this field is [Stanford's Mobilize Center](http://mobilize.stanford.edu/) which seeks to integrate data related to human movement from both traditional laboratory experiments as well as some of the latest gathered from wearable technology. In doing so they have a variety of aims within the biomechanics space.
