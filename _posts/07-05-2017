Part 2: The Way of the Zen

The Stoics (Seneca most notably) implore us to see our misfortunes anew, to do away with our gripes entirelely and embrace
every occurence in our life. In particular and most relevent to our topic, Seneca offers a helpful approach to a physical injury
or handicap. He asks us to treat our ailment as a prescreption from nature instead of a wretched curse. When we are ill, we 
expect to see a doctor and be prescribed a prescription which will cure us. Seneca compares a medical prescription to that of
nature (or some might say, fortune) 'prescribing' us an injury. And what does this prescription attempt to cure us of? Our own
moral and rational failings, of course. The mere fac that we are frustrated and seek escape from the ailment is proof enough of
our shortcomings; we are mindlessly pursuing pleasure and fleeing pain when we do this.
