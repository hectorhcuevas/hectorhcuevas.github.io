title: Millenial Fallacies and Moral Confusions of Our Generation
---

##Who are we?

Our generation, like those before it, think itself quite progressive and special. We can't necessarily be faulted with this 
erronous view, for it is simply what has been occuring generation after generation for at least the last several centuries. But
it's crucial to understanding ourselves on a societal level to truly examine the merits of our beliefs. Our morals, ethics, and way of living having
have supposedly been derived from a more enlightened view of reality and our role in this world. There are many fallacies embedded
in our collective worldview, but among them I now turn to what was for myself the most pressing among them; a man's role in society.

##What's a Man to do?
Biologicalls men are programmed on a wide spectrum of behavior. While generally men compete with one another for resources and
mates, some have cooperative and others aggressive tendencies. Society has encouraged us- quite successfully- to be cooperative,
but this doesn't mean that man's inherent competitiveness on a day to day basis doesn't manifest itself. Indeed comparison is the
very hallmark of our increasingly interconnected world. With our circle of influence growing to indefinite limits, there's no 
shortage of counterparts to compare ourselves to. We analyze and see how we 'stack up' against the competition, a competition which
ironically is collective yet exists only in one's own imagination. Our tendency to share bits of information about our lives has 
increased our collective anxiety over our self-worth. Rather than being humbled by the amazing plurality of size, shape, talent 
of other men (women as well), we tremble with dread that we are woefully inadequate to exist among them- that we will never live
the glamorous life of those at the top of the imagined hierarchy. This in turn coerces us to partake in this modern day image rat
race, relentlessly competing to have our image (our virtual self) reach that coveted spot near the top of the hierarchy. We spend 
a tremendous amount of time, energy, and other resources on maintaining this inauthentic and superficial image of ourselves. The
collective dillusion is so powerful that indeed we rarely notice or ponder the necessity or even practicality of it. Hours wasted,
energy drained, and anxiety is brought on as a result- but it's okay, because everyone else is doing it too. That's life, isn't it?

##What is a Wonderful Life?
What constitutes a good life? If we are to believe the dominant ideology of our modern interconnected global society, our life 
is the sum of our good experiences minus the bad ones. We allow for some exceptions; perhaps one was born in squallor and 
worked relentlessly to earn a bountiful living and attained a higher level of socio-economic status. Surely such an individual,
in the eyes of a modern liberal, has no lesser a life than that of a born-rich elite ivy school kid right? Yet the so called 
'elite' status of the child still affords him with a whole assortment of material goods we ironically deem to constitute a good 
life. He has no student loans or other debt, his career choice isn't dictated by financial circumstances, nor is his consumption 
or choice of vacation spots (with some limits of course). As much as we think ourselves progressive, the truth is our generation 
strives for __the good life__ by chasing wealth, experiences, and material goods just as much as previous ones.  

##Where Are We Going?
Human progress is often depicted as a linear progression through time, at least in the last few centuries. In economic terms this
is mostly accurate, and market forces will likely keep the trent chugging along despite the occasional detour. This is of course
good for humanity in terms of meeting more of our basic needs, but how is it that we have lived in such a globalized world
for hundreds (thousands?) of years and have yet to find a way towards individual enlightenment? Simply put, enlightenment takes time 
to learn, and it has no immdeiate benefits to society and is therefore not valued in our market structure. Well being is valued,
and we have metrics which can measure it, but peace of mind is something too arbitrary for collective institutions to spread to its
populations. Certainly mindfulness and meditation could become a collective priority and be instituted into public schools, churches
and the like. But the crucial component is that it is still very much up to the individual to attain a more enlightened state of mind,
and given our current trajectory this doesn't seem viable on the large scale. 

##What More is There?

What more is there to our current way of life as millenials, the future leaders and teachers of the world? Is it possible to live
mindfully and without superficiality while being fully integrated to this interconnected world? There is certainly a balancing act
if such a thing is possible, for technology is often accurately described as a double-edged sword. It has the awesome power to 
bring our ideas together, to progress our sciences and collective consciousness, to challenge and make us doubt and seek our own 
answers rather than accepting the status quo. Yet it has an equally awesome power to make us mindless consumers (and producers!) 
of digital media. The line between the useful and utterly useless approaches isn't black and white, making the balance all the 
more difficult to nail down. Indeed our technology changes so rapidly that there is little doubt that the process of reevaluating 
our approach will need to take place time and time again throughout our lives. If we have any hope of escaping this collective
dillusion, we must be relentless in our pursuit of eliminating superficiality. The intentions in our interactions are a key component
in seperating the resourcefulness from the utterly pointless. If you are seeking to impress, entertain, or otherwise garner needless
attention, you can be pretty sure you're heading in the wrong direction. To get back to the heart of our inquiry, what more is there
than this superficial attention? Awareness of course, there is a collective good which can be spread- though not inspite of technology.
We can be the example, a guiding light to the minds around us, but we must be absolutely cautious to not get sucked back into the 
collective dillusion- a black hole of priorities and ethics. What's a man to do? Remain aware, vigilant, self-critical, and relentlessly
pursue the truth inspite of all superficiality around you.
