Part 1: The Inevitable

People are inherently apt to attribute their failures or successes to a single event or narrative. In hindsight, we think how foolish we were to have gone down a given path that led us to failure. This tendency spans everything to financial calamities, relationships, and as in my case, serious injuries. 

Upon initially realizing I wasn't dealing with an ordinary 'tweak' in my back, but rather a much more serious herniated disc, I felt foolish for having not realized the problem from the start. After all, certain lifts like deadlift and squat had started feeling strange or a bit 'off' and I altogether plateaud in my progression. Furthermore, I had felt this 'tweak' in my back for some time, and had even come to the correct conclusion that cycling and my bike in particular were the problem. Given my experience as a weightlifter, it seems obvious that I should have taken action long before I ended up where I eventually did; bedridden and barely able to walk.

Even after having given up cycling and deadlifting altogether, I was far too eager (having no previous experience with serious injuries) to get back into weightlifting and make up for lost time. Again, this was a mistake that ended up costing me big in the long run and again I was left with the feeling of shame as I should have (by now) known better. This is a trap many weightlifters and athletes fall into; we have a 'BTF' (BIG TOUGH FROGMAN) mentallity that tells us, 'oh, you're back feels funny?, GOOD, get out there and push through it'. 99% of the time this is an awesome mentality to have, because most of the time we aren't feeling completely ready or honed in for training it is because of something completely psychological or superficial, and we end up better off in the end for having pushed through this. Obviously this can backfire in the case of a serious injury, as healing it requires an entirely different approach. Having had some time to reflect on my injury, from its onset to my ongoing recovery, I have come to see things in a new light and realized it wasn't at all as avoidable as it might seem. One might even say it was inevitable.
