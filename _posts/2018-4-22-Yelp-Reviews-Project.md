title: Analysis of Gym Reviews on Yelp
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This data science project utilizes the Kaggle Yelp dataset and focuses on the analysis of reviews for gym/fitness facilities. There were 2,000+ businesses in the dataset which fell into this category, and a total of ~34,000 reviews to analyze. I first ran exploratory data analysis to find general trends and demographics among the businesses. I then turned my focus to reviews and used sentiment analysis, clustering, and topic modeling to uncover trends and key factors which characterized negative and positive reviews.
